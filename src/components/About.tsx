            Hi, I'm Adam, and I build software that works.
          </p>
          <p>
            For decades, I've been turning ideas into reality as a software
            engineer. Most of that time was spent at leading tech companies like
            IBM and Shopify, where I gained deep experience in developing
            scalable systems and delivering quality products.
          </p>
          <p>
            At heart, I'm a creator. Whether it's designing systems from scratch
            or refining the details that make a user's experience seamless, I
            build products that are delightful to use and easy to maintain.
            Recently, I channeled this passion into building an indie game with
            a friend, blending creativity and technical expertise into a project
            I'm proud to share.
          </p>
          <p>
            Freelancing allows me to collaborate on a wide variety of meaningful
            projects while maintaining the flexibility to continue exploring
            personal endeavors. I enjoy working with teams to solve unique
            challenges, balancing speed and pragmatism with thoughtful
            architectural decisions when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach to software is about impact â€” crafting intuitive
            designs, delivering strong user experiences, and building systems
            tailored to the needs of the project. Whether it's shipping a
            startup's MVP quickly and efficiently or designing for long-term
            scalability, I bring a balanced, practical mindset to every
            challenge. If you're looking for an experienced developer with a
            user-centered approach, I'd love to connect.
